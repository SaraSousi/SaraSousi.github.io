abstract: Background\:colon Diabetes during pregnancy, whether gestational or pre-existing diabetes, is associated with increased maternal and neonatal risks. Remote care (telemedicine and remote monitoring) has shown promise in diabetes management, however, its impact on antenatal care remains unclear. This review aims to evaluate its impact compared with usual care for pregnant women with diabetes, using the Institute of Medicine’s healthcare quality framework: effectiveness, safety, efficiency, timeliness, patient-centeredness, and equity. Methods\:colon A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, MIDIRS, Scopus, Cochrane, and Global Health) were searched for original research studies published between 2005 and 2025,  with no geographic or language restrictions. Two independent reviewers screened studies and assessed quality using Cochrane tools. A narrative synthesis and meta-analyses were performed. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251024685).Findings\:colon A total of 917 unique studies were retrieved, of which 35 were included (n=13,790). Remote care was generally comparable to usual care across multiple efficiency and safety outcomes, though some differences were noted. It was associated with reduced risks of operative vaginal birth (RR=0·81 in non-RCTs), emergency caesarean (RR=0·49 in RCTs), and NICU admission (RR=0·87) compared to usual care. However, greater gestational weight gain (MD=0·82 kg) and elevated post-partum 2-hour glucose levels (MD=0·53) were observed. For patient-centredness, all studies reported high satisfaction levels. Findings on efficiency, cost savings and appointment frequency, were mixed. Only two studies reported timeliness outcomes, with no significant differences being observed. Direct equity outcomes were not quantified but several interventions incorporated cultural, linguistic, or technological adaptations to improve accessibility. Interpretation\:colon Remote care is a safe and effective alternative to usual care for pregnant women with diabetes, particularly in reducing operative delivery and NICU admissions. It is a patient-centred approach, offering added efficiency by reducing the need for in-person visits. Further research is required to evaluate its impact on longer-term postpartum outcomes and ability to be safely adopted across diverse populations.
